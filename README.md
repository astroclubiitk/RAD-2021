# Summer Project: Reading, Analysis and Discussion (RAD)
## Astronomy Club, SnT Council, IITK

This repository would be updated with the project resources, assignments and relevant jupyter notebooks.


*__Abstract__*: To understand the Universe and its intricacies, it is essential to do a proper study of the different astrophysical  objects and related phenomena. The project aims to do the same from a theoretical astrophysics perspective. We shall try to understand how locations and distances are measured on the cosmic scale and then see how Newton’s two body problem produces the path of the gigantic binary stars. Towards the end, we shall see how it all began, that is, the Universe’s birth.

*__Expected Workload__*: 4 hr/week

*__Mentor(s)__*: Mohammad Saad, Varun Muralidharan, Mubashshir Uddin
